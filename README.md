Social Media Behavior Analysis and Prediction
This project aims to analyze social media behavior and predict various aspects such as self-image, addictive tendencies, and procrastination based on user data.

Overview
Social media platforms play a significant role in shaping user behavior and psychology. Understanding how individuals interact with social media and how it affects their mental health and productivity is crucial for various applications, including personalized interventions, targeted advertising, and public health campaigns.

This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze user data collected from social media surveys. By building predictive models, we can gain insights into how different factors such as usage patterns, demographics, and platform preferences influence user behavior.

Features
Data preprocessing: The project includes functions to preprocess raw survey data, converting categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
Model building: Using the processed data, multivariate linear regression models are constructed to predict various behavioral aspects, including self-image, addictive tendencies, and procrastination.
Visualization: The project provides visualizations to showcase the model predictions and allow for better interpretation of the results.
Extensibility: Additional features and models can be easily integrated into the project to expand its capabilities and accommodate future research or application needs.
